    </h1>
  <p> <B>Usman Sikander</B> (a.k.a Offensive-Panda) is a seasoned security professional passionate to identifying and researching advanced evasion techniques, to develop a comprehensive understanding of threat tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through in-depth analysis of real-world attack scenarios, prominent Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns, and emerging evasion tactics for validating security postures through emulations. With a proven track record in developing exploits aligned with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and automating exploit processes, I excel in conducting comprehensive simulations within controlled environments that include all security controls. My primary objective is to identify the weaknesses, mis-configuration, vulnerabilities, validate the security controls, incident response capabilities and identify areas for improvement, deliver detailed threat analysis for proactive threat hunting, providing adversary attack paths, indicators of attack (IOAs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and actionable mitigation strategies to strengthen and enhance an organisation's detection engineering capabilities.</p>
