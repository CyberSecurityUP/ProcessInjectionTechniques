  <p>My name is <B>Usman Sikander</B> (a.k.a Offensive-Panda). My professional interests encompass adversary emulation, malware development, malware analysis, red teaming, security control validation, and detection engineering. My expertise extends to analyzing real-world samples to extract TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), validating security postures through APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) emulations, and developing undetected exploits across MITRE ATT&CK tactics. I am committed to enhancing security measures and defenses through meticulous research and practical application.</p>
