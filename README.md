</div>

This comprehensive process injection series is crafted for cybersecurity enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals who aim to stay at the forefront of the field. It serves as a central repository of knowledge, offering in-depth exploration of various process injection techniques used by adversaries.

--------------------------------------------------

### Purpose
The purpose of the Process Injection Series is to share valuable knowledge with the cybersecurity community, particularly those eager to learn about malware development and advanced evasion techniques. Through this series, I aim to not only expand my own expertise but also provide a centralized resource for all tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) related to process injection. By doing so, I hope to empower others with the skills and understanding needed to navigate and contribute to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

--------------------------------------------------
###  Shellcode
Throughout the series, I will be using my custom-generated shellcode, which displays a message box with the text "Hello from Offensive Panda." This shellcode serves as a consistent and straightforward payload for demonstrating various process injection techniques. However, you are encouraged to experiment with different shellcodes tailored to your needs, allowing you to explore and apply the concepts in ways that best suit your learning objectives or project requirements.
